  Store test and coverage reports for use in a Sonar analysis.
  Use this command when you intend to run the analysis in a separate job.

  If your project is compiled (java), the recommendation is to analyse in the
  same job that performed the build and ran the tests since the scanner will
  need the binaries.

steps:
  - persist_to_workspace:
      root: .
      paths:
        - "**/TEST-*.xml"
        - "**/coverage/**"
        - "**/test-result/**"
        - "**/jacoco.xml"
        - "**/*.exec"
